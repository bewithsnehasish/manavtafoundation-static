                            <p>Poverty and malnutrition have always been a huge problem for India, especially in the
                                rural areas and tribal belts. COVID-19 created an alarming situation for people who were
                                already below the poverty line, as they did not have even odd jobs to work during this
                                difficult time.
                                We are making constant efforts to reach out to families in dire need with the help of
                                our campaign, Garib Parivar Ration Yojana (GPRY). Under this campaign, we provide
                                monthly ration to families that are associated with us every month. All these families
                                are provided with Ration Cards, and they receive a grocery kit at the beginning of every
                                month.
                                There are many families that need your help in these difficult times and we are putting
                                in all possible efforts to help more and more such families throughout India. The Garib
                                Parivar Ration Yojana provides underprivileged families with food supplies like wheat
                                flour, pulses, cooking oil, and spices, etc. Each family is provided with a monthly
                                supply to ensure that no one in their families has to go to bed hungry. So far, we have

                        areas where there is a shortage of water. The plan wants people in the community to
                        work together and make decisions. It wants people to use water wisely, fill up the
                        groundwater again, and save water.
                        This scheme wants to make sure there is enough clean water for drinking and farming.
                        The plan focuses on including local people, especially farmers, in taking care of
                        groundwater. The government hopes that this plan will help save water and make sure

                            Road safety teaches people how to conduct themselves while driving or crossing roads. Road
                            safety
                            measures, including the use of road barriers and highway barriers, are aimed at reducing the
                            risks
                            of people getting involved in accidents in the first place. Following these measures, the
                            chances of
                            accidents, injuries and damage to property are vastly reduced.
                            Importance of road safety
                            There is a constant uptick in the number of vehicles on the road. If you feel that the
                            traffic
                            conditions are bad right now, they will only worsen in the upcoming years unless people
                            follow
                            road
                            safety measures and traffic awareness to make life easier for everyone.
                            There are a few factors that lead to such accidents in the country. Some of them are unsafe
                            driving,
                            disregard for traffic rules and regulations, users refraining from using helmets and seat
                            belts
                            and
                            so on.
                            The government of India follows road safety week between the 11th to 17th of January. Road
                            safety
                            awareness week aims at improving road safety awareness across the country with the help of a
                            few
                            methods, including pedestrian safety, road safety signage, and road and safety.
                            Key objectives of road safety week
                            It is essential to drive at slower speeds. Research shows that for an increase of 1% in
                            speed,
                            the
                            chances of accidents increase by 4%.
                            One must altogether avoid the usage of phones or other gadgets for any sort of activities
                            that
                            can
                            be distracting. It is hazardous as it reduces the reaction time, making it difficult to
                            react to
                            changes.
                            Using a good helmet while riding a bike is critical, irrespective of whether you are riding
                            or
                            being
                            a pillion rider. The presence of a helmet can reduce the risk of severe accidents and death
                            by a
                            considerable margin.

                        </h5>
                        Cancer is a disease* which occurs when changes in a group of normal cells within the body lead
                        to
                        uncontrolled, abnormal growth forming a lump called a tumour; this is true of all cancers except
                        leukaemia (cancer of the blood). If left untreated, tumours can grow and spread into the
                        surrounding
                        normal tissue, or to other parts of the body via the bloodstream and lymphatic systems, and can
                        affect the digestive, nervous and circulatory systems or release hormones that may affect body
                        function. At certain times of the year, we mark awareness days, weeks or months to help spread
                        the
                        word about how to help prevent different kinds of cancers, and how to spot them early. The
                        emerging
                        India helps to aware the people about this . Below are some of the cancer awareness periods we
                        regularly cover, with links to helpful resources on each cancer. .
